# ReactND: Readable

The second project of the [Udacity React Nanodegree](
https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The goal is to create a content website similar to Reddit. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.
